# React First Application

Welcome in my house, cars and motorcycles Sale App üè† !

## Run the application

You can preview it on [Vercel](https://first-react-app-gamma-two.vercel.app/).

Or to run locally use :

``` code
git clone https://github.com/Friedrich482/first-react-app.git
```

After that, go in the root of the project and install all dependencies by using :

``` code
npm install
```

And finally to serve the project locally, use the command :

``` code
npm run dev
```

After that open ```localhost:3000``` to see the result.

## Project RoadMap

- This project will involve into something with not only **Houses**  to sale but also **Cars** and **Bikes**. So I will practice React Router to create multiple pages. Users have to be able to add any of these articles and add them in their *basket*.
- Many pages are needed :
  - Home
  - Houses
  - Cars
  - Bikes
  - ...
- Practice the usage of packages like **react-icons**, **react-toastify**, **react-spinners**
- This list may be updated
